 In this project I used jupyter notebooks and the pandas library to analyse demographic data and answer some questions. The questions were:
  1.How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
  2.What is the average age of men?
  3.What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
  4.What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
  5.What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
  6.What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
  7.What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
  8.What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
  9.Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

The data was from extracted from the 1994 sensus database of the United States of America. The data was then parsed into the csv file "adult.data.csv"
